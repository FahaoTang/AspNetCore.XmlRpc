# AspNetCore.XmlRpc
XML-RPC .NET Standard library with MetaWeblog implementations for ASP.NET Core 2.x

# Build Status

# Detail
Why do we need XML-RPC if we have advanced technology to use such as SOAP or WCF?
The answer is: some applications are still using XML-RPC based protocols to communicate. For example, Open Live Writer (formerly named Windows Live Writer) supports MetaWeblog APIs when publishing blogs.
This project is migrated from the .NET 2 version to support ASP.NET Core. A number of components have been refactored to follow .NET Core standards. However not all the components are re-written yet.
